One of the main challenges appearedfaced during this lab was to understand and properly execute the call mechanism in Assembly language, especially with regard to managing the stack and registers as taught in class. The Assembly language is very low level; therefore, even a seemingly easy task such as passing a number to a function and verifying whether it is odd or even needs to be handled very carefully. It took about a week to understand the relationship between ebp and esp in forming stack frames and in addressing function parameters through the stack. And then there came the challenge of implementing the system call correctly for printing the result to the console without the program crashing or giving no output when incorrect parameters were sent. Debugging proved to be tough-side because the errors were not always clear, so it would require a step-by-step inspection of the code through registers to identify ones. Overall, it was a worthwhile exercise that cemented some fundamental areas of low-level programming for me and drilled into me the importance of sticking to calling conventions rigidly.
